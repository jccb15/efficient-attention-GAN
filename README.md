# Efficient Attention GAN (EAGAN)

This repository presents an implementations of a denominated Efficient Attention GAN for unpaired image-to-image translation.
This architectures follows the CycleGAN framework to introduce Efficient Attention blocks in the generator network of the translation process. This architecture is illustrated in the following figure.

## Results
to evaluate and compare the performance between the proposed architecture against competing solutions, a series of models were trained from scratch on data sets for object and scenery translation. The KID score was used as the main
comparison metric.

### Attention-Map Visualization

An interesting aspect to observe from the trained
EAGAN model are the computed attention
maps for a given input. These maps can be observed by visualizing each channel in the Key vector from the efficient attention block. By doing so, it is possible to get an intuition of how each attention map attend to different areas of the image as observed in the following figure.
